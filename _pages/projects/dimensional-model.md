# Ace Superstore: Dimensional Modeling & Power BI Reporting

## Project Overview

This project is the second phase of the Ace Superstore sales analysis initiative. Following an initial exploratory data analysis (Task 1), this phase focuses on building a robust, scalable, and query-optimized reporting system. The primary goal was to transform the cleaned dataset into a structured **Star Schema** dimensional model using SQL and then develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI to uncover strategic business insights.

> **Problem Statement:** "Following the foundational analysis in Task 1, Ace Superstore now aims to build a structured, query-optimized reporting system. Your responsibility in this task is twofold: 1. Design and implement a star schema using SQL. 2. Create SQL views from your schema and connect them directly to Power BI to produce advanced interactive dashboards."

## 📈 Executive Summary: Key Insights & Recommendations

This analysis has uncovered a **critical profitability crisis** at Ace Superstore. While revenue is being generated, the current pricing and discount strategies are unsustainable, leading to significant financial losses across all operational regions.

### Key Findings:

*   **Widespread Regional Losses:** The business is unprofitable in every single region, accumulating a total net loss of **£-788,871.96**. The "Regional Profitability Overview" chart clearly visualizes this alarming trend, with East Midlands showing the most significant losses.
*   **Ineffective Discount Strategy:** The "Discount vs. Profit Analysis" scatter plot reveals a strong negative correlation. As the discount rate increases, average profit plummets. Many sales, particularly those with high discounts, result in a direct financial loss.
*   **Extreme Negative Profit Margins:** The average profit margin across both In-Store and Online channels is approximately **-260%**. This indicates a severe structural issue with the company's cost of goods, pricing, and discount policies.
*   **Identification of Top Customers:** Despite overall losses, we have identified a cohort of high-value customers. The "Top 10 Customers by Profit Contribution" chart highlights individuals like `QC056257` who, while still part of a loss-making system, represent the most valuable segment.

### Strategic Recommendations:

1.  **Immediate Pricing & Discount Review:** Urgently conduct a full review of the discounting strategy. High-discount promotions (>20%) should be halted immediately on products identified as money-losers.
2.  **Focus on Profit-Driving Products:** Although the overall picture is negative, the "Category Ranking by Region" matrix allows for a granular analysis of the *least unprofitable* products. These should be prioritized in marketing and inventory.
3.  **Enhance Customer Loyalty Programs:** The top-performing customers should be nurtured. A targeted loyalty program could increase their purchase frequency and value, providing a stable, less unprofitable revenue stream.
4.  **Channel-Specific Strategy:** Investigate why both Online and In-Store channels are performing so poorly. Analyze operational costs, return rates, and channel-specific customer behaviors to tailor a recovery strategy for each.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Model & Schema

The foundation of this report is a robust **Star Schema** implemented in a MySQL database. This schema separates descriptive attributes (dimensions) from quantitative measures (facts), which optimizes query performance and simplifies analytical reporting.

### Setup & Replication Instructions

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

#### 1. SQL Database Setup
1.  **Create Database:** Set up a new MySQL database named `ace_database`.
2.  **Load Staging Data:** Create the `staging_sales` table and load the `cleaned_sales.csv` data from Task 1.
3.  **Execute SQL Scripts:** Run the following SQL scripts from the `sql/` folder in the specified order:
    1.  `1_create_tables.sql` - To build the fact and dimension tables.
    2.  `2_populate_dimensions.sql` - To insert data into all `dim_` tables.
    3.  `3_populate_fact_table.sql` - To insert data into `fact_sales` (with the correct profit calculation).
    4.  `4_create_views.sql` - To create all the `vw_` summary views for Power BI.

#### 2. Power BI Connection
1.  **Open Power BI Desktop** and click on "Get Data".
2.  Select **"MySQL database"** from the list of data sources.
3.  Enter the server details (e.g., `localhost`) and the database name (`ace_database`).
4.  In the Navigator window, select all the views (`vw_...`) created in the previous step.
5.  Click **"Load"** to import the data into Power BI and begin building the visuals as described.
